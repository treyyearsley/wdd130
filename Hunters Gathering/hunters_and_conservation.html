    <p>Hunters make up one of the largest conservation groups in the world.
         We love what we do, and we love what and where we hunt. 
         It is for this reason that we do all we can to protect the resources that we use. 
         There are several ways that hunters do this. 
         The RMEF (Rocky Mountains Elk Foundation), Mule Deer Foundation, Ducks Unlimited, and other groups invite people to join the group. 
         There is a small amount of money required to join these groups, but it is this money that goes to preserving the future of hunting. 
         There are habitat restoration projects that restore habitat in places that it was lost. 
         There are plots of land that are purchased in order to allow access to public land that recreators would other wise not be able to access. 
         There are game transports to reintroduce animals back into what used to be some of their home range. 
         The other way that hunter contribute to conservation is by the licenses, tags, and permits that they buy and use. 
         The money from the sale of tags goes into funding for the local Fish and Wildlife departments. 
         This helps them to have sufficient funds to conducts surveys, experiments and to watch for poaching or other illegal outdoor activities. 
         These tags also help by keeping herd, pack, and flocks in check. 
         Without animals being killed by hunters the animals would overpopulate. 
         When this happens there is a cycle. 
         When the prey animals have high populations, they eventual outgrow their range and run out of food. 
         Also, during this phase, the predators are on the rise because of the increase of food. 
         When the prey runs out of food, they begin to die off which leads to the predators running out of food. 
         Then they begin to die off. 
         Once there is a low population there is sufficient food for the prey animals and the cycle begins again. 
         With the help of hunters this cycle is minimized. 
         We control the herd numbers and the pack numbers making sure that one does not outgrow the other.
