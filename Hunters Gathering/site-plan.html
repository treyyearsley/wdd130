      <h3>Share your story</h3>
      <p>
        Hunting is a great way to meet new people and make new friends.  
        Often as hunter we need to work together in order to be successful. 
        This goes for being successful on a hunt to helping create healthy herds from which we can hunt. 
        This page is to share your success, and suggestions with fellow hunters.

        Success

        As a hunter and outdoorsman, it is great to share your success with others and let others know about your achievements. 
        We would like to see your successes. This does not need to be only pictures of animals that you harvested, it could be a hike you completed, a hidden lake you found, a fish you caught and any other sort of achievement in the outdoors.
        This is a place you can share your success without the fear of being censored by a social media website.

        Tips and tactics

        As mentioned on the home page many hunters and outdoorsman spend years perfecting their skills and learning from their mistakes.
        On this page we will help other learn from our mistakes.
        These tips can be very helpful so do not be afraid to share. It will help someone. 
        I will start by sharing one of my tactics.
        It is a very good idea buy good optics. Hunting, especially in the west is a glassing game. 
        You may sit on a ridge for hours glassing to pick a deer, elk, or anything off of a distant adjacent hill. 
        The better glass you have the easier this will be. Your eyes will feel much better and the optics will be more clear and improve your success.

      <h3>Hunters and Conservation</h3>
      <p>
        Hunters make up one of the largest conservation groups in the world. 
        We love what we do, and we love what and where we hunt. 
        It is for this reason that we do all we can to protect the resources that we use. 
        There are several ways that hunters do this. The RMEF (Rocky Mountains Elk Foundation), Mule Deer Foundation, Ducks Unlimited, and other groups invite people to join the group.
        There is a small amount of money required to join these groups, but it is this money that goes to preserving the future of hunting. 
        There are habitat restoration projects that restore habitat in places that it was lost. 
        There are plots of land that are purchased in order to allow access to public land that recreators would other wise not be able to access. 
        There are game transports to reintroduce animals back into what used to be some of their home range.
        
        The other way that hunter contribute to conservation is by the licenses, tags, and permits that they buy and use. 
        The money from the sale of tags goes into funding for the local Fish and Wildlife departments. 
        This helps them to have sufficient funds to conducts surveys, experiments and to watch for poaching or other illegal outdoor activities.
        These tags also help by keeping herd, pack, and flocks in check. Without animals being killed by hunters the animals would overpopulate. 
        When this happens there is a cycle. When the prey animals have high populations, they eventual outgrow their range and run out of food.
        Also, during this phase, the predators are on the rise because of the increase of food. 
        When the prey runs out of food, they begin to die off which leads to the predators running out of food. 
        Then they begin to die off. Once there is a low population there is sufficient food for the prey animals and the cycle begins again.
        With the help of hunters this cycle is minimized. We control the herd numbers and the pack numbers making sure that one does not outgrow the other.
